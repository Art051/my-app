# Game outline/description:
- Bingo cards are generated using parameters to establish what the number being studied is
- What the min and max multiplication is that they should know 
- How many items per player card
- If the card should show the formulas or the products

## Project purpose:
- Having followed AWS start-up tutorial previously, now aiming to utilise AWS to host a project.
- Develop some knowledge of Vaadin while making the project, then host project on AWS.
- Fulfill promise of making a bingo game generator for someone to use to save them time.

## TO-DO
- Figure out hosting for web-app - going with Heroku I reckon (hopefully).
- Implement new generated file/folder structure to make viewing PDFs and CSVs separately possible. 
- ~Implement a way to limit the number of CSV + PDFs created/stored to preserve app size.~
- ~Generate PDF containing tables representing each card generated.~
- ~Refactor and tidy up a lot.~ Tidied up a little.
- ~Figure out binding of boolean fields.~ Done
